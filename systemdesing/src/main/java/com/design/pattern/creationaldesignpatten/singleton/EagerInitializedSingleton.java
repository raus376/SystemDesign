//If your singleton class is not using a lot of resources, this is the approach to
//use. But in most of the scenarios, Singleton classes are created for resources
//such as File System, Database connections etc and we should avoid the
//instantiation until unless client calls the getInstance method. Also this
//method doesn’t provide any options for exception handling.

public class EagerInitializedSingleton {

    private static final EagerInitializedSingleton instance = new EagerInitializedSingleton();

    private EagerInitializedSingleton() {}

    public static EagerInitializedSingleton getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }

}

//✅ Implements Singleton Pattern using eager initialization.
//🧱 Single instance is created at class loading time.
//🔒 Private constructor prevents external instantiation.
//📦Static final instance ensures only one object exists.
//🌍 Global access point via getInstance() method.
//🧵 Thread-safe by default (JVM loads static variables safely).
//⚠️ Drawback: Instance is created even if never used (no lazy loading).
